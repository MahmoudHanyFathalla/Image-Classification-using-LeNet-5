# Image-Classification-using-LeNet-5
This project focuses on image classification using the LeNet-5 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The goal is to classify images into predefined categories by training a deep learning model on a dataset of labeled images. The project includes data loading, model training, and evaluation, as well as inference on single images.
